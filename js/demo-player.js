/* Demo player — the Archie recording plays by itself, silently, on a loop.
 *
 * Four things this has to get right, none of which a bare `autoplay loop` attribute does:
 *
 *  0. Send the right encode. The same recording ships as AV1, HEVC and H.264 at two widths, and
 *     the choice is made on decode COST, not just codec support — see pickSource below. This is
 *     the difference between a hero that idles at nothing and one that pins a core on an old
 *     laptop.
 *
 *  1. Don't fetch megabytes until they're wanted. Neither the <video> nor its <source>s carry a
 *     real src — only data-src — so the browser fetches nothing but the poster until an
 *     IntersectionObserver says the figure is actually on screen. Someone who bounces never pays.
 *
 *  2. Don't play to an empty room. Playback pauses when the figure scrolls away and resumes
 *     when it comes back, so we're not decoding video into a viewport nobody is looking at —
 *     which on a laptop is just battery, quietly.
 *
 *  3. Respect prefers-reduced-motion. Anyone who has asked the OS for less movement gets the
 *     poster and a play button, and the video is only fetched if they ask for it. Autoplaying
 *     at them would be exactly the thing they turned off.
 *
 * The visible control is a pause toggle, not player chrome: WCAG 2.2.2 requires a way to stop
 * motion that starts on its own and runs past five seconds, and this runs for a minute.

  /* ── Which of the encodes does this machine actually want? ──
   *
   * The markup offers the same recording as AV1, HEVC and H.264, at two widths. Picking with a
   * plain <source> list would be wrong, because the browser only asks "can I decode this?" — and
   * the answer is yes far more often than it should be. A 2019 laptop will cheerfully claim it
   * supports AV1 and then software-decode 2560px of it, burning a core to do it. "Supported" and
   * "free to play" are different questions.
   *
   * MediaCapabilities answers the second one: powerEfficient means there is a hardware decoder
   * behind it. So we take the best candidate that is hardware-decoded and skip anything that
   * would be decoded in software — which is how a machine that can't do AV1 in hardware quietly
   * ends up on the HEVC or H.264 line instead of stuttering through the pretty one.
   *
   * If nothing is hardware-decoded, we take the LAST candidate rather than the first: the list is
   * ordered best-quality-first, and the last one is H.264, which is the cheapest thing to grind
   * out in software.
   *
   * Browsers too old to have MediaCapabilities are also too old to have AV1 (it shipped in Chrome
   * 70; MediaCapabilities in 66), so canPlayType alone is safe for them — they cannot pick the
   * expensive option even if we let them.
